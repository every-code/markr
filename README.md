> Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is 
designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.

## Getting started

### CSS
The `css` folder in the root directory contains all the necessary CSS files for the editor. The base CSS file is `style.css` which contains the base style of the project. The rest are theme files which basically contain the style for colour and background-colour of various objects.

### JS
The `js` folder contains all the Javascript files needed to extend the functionality of the project.

### HTML
All the layout required by the project is put in html. As the project grows, there may be multiple html files which will then be put into a serparate `html` folder. But for now, there is only one file `index.html` in the root directory.

## Opening an issue
If you find a bug or feel like you want a new theme, feel free to open an issue with a detailed description about the issue.
